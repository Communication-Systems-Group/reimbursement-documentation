Our expression of thanks goes to all the people involved in this master-project. Foremost, we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller for giving us the opportunity to conduct the project at his chair. Many thanks also go to Thomas Bocek and Andri Lareida for their valuable assistance. We always highly appreciated the many inputs given by all other members of the CSG and last but not least we would like to thank Claudia Leibundgut, who supported us by sharing deep insights into the details of the finance-admin role.
