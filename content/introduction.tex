\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The actual reimbursement process at the University of Zurich is cumbersome and contains several media disruptions. Excel documents will be created, printed, reviewed, adapted, printed and reviewed again. Numeral iterations lead to waste of paper, time and energy. Furthermore travel expenses as well as expenses need to be printed, attached, scanned and reviewed by the financial administration of each IFI department. To reduce the efforts taken for reimbursement tasks, especially on creation and review actions during the process for all participants, a new Web-based portal will be developed.

\section{Description of Work}

The aim of this project work is to design and implement a Web-based portal and its back- end functionality to operate the travel reimbursement process with a centralized and database-driven approach. The work consists of the design of a information model, the relational database model for storing reimbursement data, and the respective new travel reimbursement form. Furthermore, the development of the web portal and applications for displaying and inputting reimbursementinformation, the supervisor’s approval site, the respective financial department’s portal, and the technical administrative Web site are needed. Finally, the entire web portal and application, which shall maintain in the future the entirety of all IFI-based travel reimbursement information, shall also be tested in CSG-internal approach.


\section{Project Scope}

In our project we implement the most used features of the reimbursement process at the IFI department at the University of Zurich. This consists the complete process of creation, review, rejection, accept and print of expense elements. Besides that a synchronised interface to the existing LDAP is crucial for the user management.
