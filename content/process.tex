\section{Process Capturing}
The currently established process has been captured based on the documents, regulations and policies that the finance administration UZH provides to the finance administrations at the individual departments. Moreover also several semi-structured and informal interviews with Claudia Leibundgut from the finance administration at the Department of Informatics (IFI) and with researchers at the Communication Systems Group (CSG) have been conducted.\par
The emerged process has then been digitally enabled and validated again in collaboration with Claudia Leibundgut (representative for the finance administration IFI) and Thomas Bocek (representative for the CSG). The new and digitally enabled process is depicted as "business process model"\cite{bpmn} in figure \ref{sec:process-diagram-rotated}.

\section{Digitally Enabled Reimbursement Process}
\label{sec:processflow}
The process starts in the lane \textit{Expense Creator}: an expense arises and the \textit{Expense Creator} creates a new expense in the system, adds all the expense receipts and submits the whole expense to the next higher instance for validation. After the validations by the \textit{Manager} or its \textit{Deputy} and by the \textit{Finance administration IFI} are successful, the signing-process will start.\newline
During the signing-process, all three entities, namely the \textit{Expense Creator}, the \textit{Manager} or its \textit{Deputy} and the \textit{Finance administration IFI} need to sign the document. All entities can only sign with the same type of signing, i.e. all digitally or all electronically. If all of them have signed the document, the \textit{Expense Creator} can print the expense and hand it physically over to the \textit{Finance administration IFI}.\newline
Since this part of the process is still performed manually, Claudia Leibundgut proposed that the Expense Creators should send the post-mail directly to the \textit{Finance administration UZH}. This bears the risk that manipulations by the \textit{Expense Creators} go unnoticed.\newline
At the point of printing, the sub-process "expense-creation" is at its end and all further activities are out of scope of the reimbursement tool, as it is specified in the project scope. The chapter \ref{sec:future-work} offers further improvements to the current, and even more important, to the part of the process that currently is out of scope. To name an example, all of the expense receipts will be printed and after validation through the \textit{Finance administration UZH} they will be digitalized again. This media disruption could be resolved by extending our tool, which is further elaborated on in section \ref{sec:process-improvements}.\par

The new and digitally enabled process is depicted as BPM\cite{bpmn} in figure \ref{sec:process-diagram-rotated}. This new process implies certain roles and states. These are further described in section \ref{sec:states} and \ref{sec:user-roles}.

\subsection{Corner Cases}
\label{sec:corner-cases}
If a \textit{Manager} will act as a \textit{Expense Creator} the expense will only be submitted to the \textit{Finance administration} for approval. During the signing-process, the \textit{Manager}'s manager has to sign as a higher authority. Analogous, if the \textit{Expense Creator} is \textit{Finance administrator IFI}, \textit{Department Manager} or \textit{Head of Institute}.\par 
At this point, an illustrative step-through may be clarifying:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Step-Through:} (create) - (validate) - (sign) - (sign) - (sign)
		\item \textbf{Manager:} Manager - Fadmin IFI - Manager - Depman - Fadmin IFI
		\item \textbf{Depman:} Depman - Fadmin IFI - Depman - Headinst  - Fadmin IFI
		\item \textbf{Headinst:} Headinst - Fadmin IFI - Headinst - Depman - Fadmin IFI	
	\end{itemize}
	
Another corner case are finance administration personnel: Here, after the creation of the expense, the expense is sent straight to the finance administration's "expense pool". In the case of finance administrators submitting their expenses to the pool, of course these expenses cannot be self-assigned and only validated by other \textit{finance administrators} but not themselves.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fadmin:} fadmin1 ifi - fadmin2 ifi - fadmin1 ifi - depman - fadmin2 ifi
\end{itemize}

\subsection{States}
\label{sec:states}
During the process an expense passes through various states. An expense is always in one and only one of the states defined in the following section. The State-diagram in \ref{sec:state-diagram} visualizes the pass through graphically. Users have different roles and therefore also different competencies to modify the state of an expense.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{DRAFT} state occurs if the expense is created and yet has not been assigned to a \textit{Manager}.
	
	\item \textbf{TO\_BE\_ASSIGNED} state occurs if the expense is submitted, but has not been assigned to a specific manager or the \textit{Finance administration} user. If the expense has been assigned, the expense will either have the state \newline \textbf{ASSIGNED\_TO\_MANAGER} or \newline \textbf{ASSIGNED\_TO\_FINANCE\_ADMIN}.
	
	\item \textbf{ASSIGNED\_TO\_MANAGER} state occurs if the expense is assigned to a specific \textit{Manager}.
	
	\item \textbf{ASSIGNED\_TO\_FINANCE\_ADMIN} state occurs if the expense is assigned to a specific \textit{Finance admin}.
	
	\item \textbf{REJECTED} state occurs if the created expense is not accepted by the \textit{Manager}, \textit{Department manager} or the \textit{Finance administration}. In \textbf{REJECTED} state the expense will be reassigned to the user who created it.
	
	\item \textbf{SIGNED} state occurs if the expense has been signed by all participants; \textit{Expense Creator}, \textit{Manager} or \textit{Department manager} and \textit{Finance administration}. There exist sub states that occur if the expense is in the process of being signed:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{TO\_BE\_SIGNED\_BY\_USER} occurs if the expense needs to be signed by the \textit{Expense Creator}.
		\item \textbf{TO\_BE\_SIGNED\_BY\_MANAGER} occurs if the expense needs to be \newline signed by the \textit{Manager}.
		\item \textbf{TO\_BE\_SIGNED\_BY\_FINANCE\_ADMIN} occurs if the expense \newline needs to be signed by an user with role \textit{Finance administration}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{PRINTED} state occurs if the expense and all its receipts are successfully converted into a digital document.
	
	\item \textbf{ARCHIVED} state occurs if the expense has been printed.
\end{itemize}

The names of the various states are coupled with the user roles. For example \textbf{\\ASSIGNED\_TO\_FINANCE\_ADMIN} implies that the expense is assigned to a user with role \textit{Finance Administration}.

\section{User roles}
\label{sec:user-roles}

The reimbursement-tool retrieves information about users from the IFI LDAP server. Every user that exists in the LDAP is capable to login to the system. To login to the system, the user can use it's IFI LDAP credentials. \par

The reimbursement-tool provides different user roles. Also the roles on the reimbursement-tool are mapped with the LDAP user roles of the IFI. As an example will all employees that are assigned in LDAP to a certain group be managed by the professor of that group. Additionally to the LDAP roles, the reimbursement-tool assigns technical roles based on the registration status:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User}: Users who are authorized to login the reimbursement-tool but have not yet completed the registration process receive the \textit{User} role. They have, like anonymous users, only access to the public REST services (see \ref{sec:rest-services}).
	
	\item \textbf{Registered User}: Users that passed the registration process, are \textit{Registered Users}. They can access the reimbursement-tool and additionally, \textit{Registered Users} get another role based on the LDAP information:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{Expense Creator} is authorized to create and edit expenses as long as they have not been submitted to its \textit{Manager}.
		
		\item The \textbf{Manager} is authorized to reject, accept and edit expenses from the group he/she manages as long as they are assigned to him/her i.e have not yet been submitted to the next instance in the process.
		
		\item The \textbf{Department Manager} has the same competencies as the \textit{Manager}. If a \textit{Manager} is outreach, his assignments will be forwarded to the respective \textit{Department manager}.
		
		\item The \textbf{Head of Institute} has the same competencies as the \textit{Manager}. In contrast to the \textit{Department manager} there exists only one user that can be \textit{Head of institute}. The \textit{Head of Institute} will have to approve the expense if, for any reason, the \textit{Department Manager} is not available.
		
		\item The \textbf{Finance Administration} is authorized to reject, accept and edit expenses once they have been accepted by a \textit{Manager} or created by a \textit{Manager}, \textit{Department Manager} or the \textit{Head of Institute}. For further details please refer to the corner cases in section \ref{sec:corner-cases}. Furthermore he/she can manage the available cost categories and search for expenses.
