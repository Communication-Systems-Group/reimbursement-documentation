\section{Registration}
\label{sec:registration}

\subsection{Step 1}
The reimbursement-tool is connected to the UZH-IFI LDAP server. This allows employees of the IFI department to use their existing login-credentials provided by the University of Zurich to login to the reimbursement-tool.\newline
After the initial login a user needs to pass a two-step registration process. On figure \ref{fig:registration-step01} the user needs to input two values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item UZH personnel number is the employee number, written on the employment card. It is of the form \textit{01-123-456}. Enter the number without the leading 0 and hyphens; i.e. \textit{123456}.
    \item UZH phone number is the personnel phone number of the employee. Please enter it in the form \textit{0441234567}.
\end{itemize}\newpage

    \label{fig:registration-step01}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Step 2}
On figure \ref{fig:registration-step02} the user needs to add his handwritten signature either by uploading an image or capture it using a third party touchscreen device, like a smart phone. This signature is required to sign the generated Pdf document containing all receipts.

After completing the registration process, these captured information and signature can always be edited by navigation to the \textbf{Settings} on the navigation bar.

\section{Expenses}

An expense is an entity captured by an \textit{Registered user}. Every expense is defined by an \textbf{accounting description} that will be visual in SAP. An expense consists of 1 to 15 receipts.

The \textit{Registered user} has to create an expense, add receipts to it and assign it to his \textit{Manager}. The \textit{Manager} will check the expense for correctness, add the corresponding projects and assign it to the \textit{Finance administration} if the expense is correct. For a detailed description of the process refer to section \ref{sec:process}.

\subsection{Create Expense}

To create an expense, the user needs to navigate to the \textbf{Dashboard} and click on the button \textbf{Create new Expense}. A modal-window will appear to enter an SAP description.\newline Once the \textit{SAP description} is entered correctly and the user clicked \textbf{Next} an empty expense will be created. The user can start with adding receipts (see figure \ref{fig:expensesitems-overview}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{expensesItems-overview}}
    \caption{Expense-View: Overview}
    \label{fig:expensesitems-overview}
\end{figure}

On the top left-hand side the \textit{SAP description} is added. The small button on the right can be used for editing. On the top right-hand side the current process step and the unprocessed steps of the expense are visualized. This process bar always indicates the state the expense is currently at.\newline
Further the user can add, edit and remove receipts. To add a new receipt the user needs to click on the button \textbf{Add new Receipt}. See Section \ref{sec:addreceipt} for details.\newline
Existing receipts can be edited and removed by clicking on the respective buttons at the Receipts-list.


\subsection{Receipt}
\label{sec:addreceipt}
By adding a new receipt or editing an existing one, the user needs to fill out the following mandatory information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Receipt date} will further be used to calculate the correct exchange rate if a foreign currency is selected.
    \item \textbf{Cost category} selected based on a pre-defined list of available cost categories.
    \item Original and calculated amount based on the exchange rate.
    \item The \textbf{project assignment} is added by a user with role \textit{Manager} or \textit{Department manager}.
    \item A short \textbf{explanation} that describes the purpose of the receipt.
    \item \textbf{Receipt attachment} used for verification purpose of the entered receipt data.
\end{itemize}

See figure \ref{fig:expenses-add01} for details.

    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{expenses-add01}}
    \caption{Expense: Add new receipt}
    \label{fig:expenses-add01}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Assign Expense to Professor}
If all receipts are captured, the expense will be assigned to the \textit{Manager} in charge. Once the assignment is processed, the expense cannot be edited by the user anymore. To assign an expense to the \textit{Manager}, click on the \textbf{Submit to Manager} button.

\subsection{States}
\label{sec:states}
Every expense is always in one of the following states during the process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Draft} state occurs if the expense is created and yet has not been assigned to a \textit{Manager}.
    
    \item \textbf{To be assigned} state occurs if the expense is submitted to the \textit{Manager} but has not been assigned to a specific \textit{Manager}.
    
    \item \textbf{Assigned to Manager} state occurs if the expense is submitted to the \textit{Manager} and has been assigned to a specific \textit{Manager}.
    
    \item \textbf{Assigned to Finance Admin} state occurs if the expense is submitted to the \textit{Manager} and has been assigned to a specific \textit{Finance admin}.
    
    \item \textbf{Rejected} state occurs if the created expense is not accepted by the \textit{Manager}, \textit{Department manager} or \textit{Finance management}. In \textbf{Rejected} status the expense will be reassigned to the user who created it.
    
    \item \textbf{Signed} state occurs if the expense has been signed by all participants; \textit{Registered user}, \textit{Manager} or \textit{Department manager} and \textit{Finance management}. There exist sub states that occur if the expense is in the process of being signed by all participants:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{To be signed by \textit{User}} occurs if the expense needs to be signed by the \textit{User}.
            \item \textbf{To be signed by \textit{Manager}} occurs if the expense needs to be signed by the \textit{Manager}.
            \item \textbf{To be signed by \textit{Finance admin}} occurs if the expense needs to be signed by the \textit{Finance admin}.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Printed} state occurs if the expense and all its receipts are successfully converted into a digital document.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sign document}
\label{sec:signing}
The signing is needed for the generation of the Pdf that contains all of the captures \textit{Expenses} and receipts. This Pdf uses the signatures of the respective \textit{User}, \textit{Manager} and \textit{Finance admin} to proof their acceptance of the captures \textit{Expenses} and receipts. During the signing process the user will be prompted to select his preferred signing method (see figure 3.5). The two different types available will be explained in detail:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{Digital signature} ensure the authenticity of the signer. Any changes made to the document after it has been signed will invalidate the signature. To use the \textit{Digital signature} the user has to provide his private key to successfully sign the document.
        \item \textbf{Electronic signature} does not ensure the authenticity of the signer. Anyone can theoretically make changes on the document after it has been signed without the signature become invalid. To use it, the user only has to add his handwritten signature.
    \end{itemize}
    
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{expenses-sign}}
    \caption{Expense: Sign document}
    \label{fig:expense-sign}
\end{figure}

Please note, that if a signing method has been selected all subsequent signers, like \textit{Manager} and \textit{Finance management} have to apply the same method.


\section{User}

Every user that exists in the LDAP of the University of Zurich is capable to login to the system. He can use the same user name and password that he uses for the other University of Zurich services for login. See Section \ref{sec:registration} for more details.

There exists different roles for users to login to the system. A user is allowed to have exactly one role out of the four defined. The roles are provided and synchronized with the LDAP-Server of the University of Zurich. The following roles exist in the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unregistered user} are users, who are authorized to login the reimbursement-tool but have not yet completed the registration process, see section \ref{sec:registration}.
    \item \textbf{Registered user / User} are authorized to create and edit \textit{Expenses} that they created. However, an expense cannot be edited once it has been assigned to a \textit{Manager}.
    
    \item \textbf{Manager / Professor} are authorized to reject, accept and edit \textit{Expenses}. A \textit{Manager} is also capable of creating \textit{Expenses} and editing them until it has been assigned. 
    
    \item \textbf{Department manager} has the same authorizations as the \textit{Manager}. If a \textit{Manager} is outreach his assignments will be forwarded to the \textit{Department manager}. There exist multiple \textit{Department manager}.
    
    \item \textbf{Finance management / Finance admin} is authorized to reject, accept and edit \textit{Expenses} once they have been accepted by a \textit{Manager} or \textit{Department managers}. Furthermore they can manage the available cost categories.
    
    \item \textbf{Head of institute} has the same authorizations as the \textit{Manager}. In contrast to the \textbf{Department manager} there exists only one \textit{Head of institute}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Guest view}
The guest view allows users to retrieve \textit{Expenses} without the need of valid login-credentials for the reimbursement-tool. They can open the guest view using a special URL, provided on every printed expense document. The URL is located on the second page in form of a QR-Code and an URL. So that the user can either scan the QR-Code or typewrite the URL in a browser window and he'll get access to the respective expense.

\section{Cost categories}

The existing cost categories of the reimbursement-tool can be edited and deactivated by the \textit{Finance management}. Furthermore a new cost category can be created by providing the German and English translation for it. See figure \ref{fig:admin-costcategories}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{admin-costcategories}}
    \caption{Administration: Cost categories}
    \label{fig:admin-costcategories}
\end{figure}

\section{Retrieve Expenses}
\subsection{Search for Expenses}

For the \textit{Finance management} a sophisticated search interface for \textit{Expenses} exist; the \textit{Admin Pool Search}. See figure \ref{fig:admin-search}. The search results will be limited by the following values:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specify the date range the expense has been created.
    \item Last name of the expense applicant.
    \item The permission / role of the applicant.
    \item The current state of the expense.
    \item Based on the selected cost category of the receipt.
    \item The accounting description (similar to the SAP description).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{admin-search}}
    \caption{Administration: Search for \textit{Expenses}}
    \label{fig:admin-search}
\end{figure}

The \textit{Finance admin} is authorized to override the following expense states:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reassign}: If the expense is in \textit{Printed} state, it can be reassigned to the \textit{Finance admin}.
\item \textbf{Reset}: During the 1. Iteration (see section \ref{sec:process}) the expense can be reset to send it back to the creator. The expense state will change to \textit{Draft}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Archive}
Besides the \textit{Admin Pool Search} there exists an archive interface for all users. The archive provides a list of all \textit{Expenses} in \textit{Printed} state that the current user has created.

\subsection{Analytics}
The reimbursement-tool provides an analytics-view for the finance administration. It should empower their knowledge about the overall amount of the captured expenses, rate of printed expenses as well as the current state distribution of the expenses.  


\section{Expense process}
\label{sec:process}

The entire process is basically divided into three iterations. The \textbf{1. iteration}; Expense creation, \textbf{2. iteration}; the Expense signing, the \textbf{3. iteration}; print and carry the documents to the finance administration of the University of Zurich.\newline 
Expense date, cost category, amount, explanation and attachment will be captured by the user to initiate the first iteration. As soon as the user is done with the capturing the Expense will be assigned to the \textit{Manager}. He reviews the Expense, adds the respective projects and assigns the Expense to the next instance for review; the \textit{Finance Management}. If they are satisfied the Expense moves into the second iteration; the signing. For more detailed information containing the signing refer to section \ref{sec:signing}.\newline

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{expense-process}}
    \caption{Expense: Process of expense creation}
    \label{fig:expense-process}
\end{figure}

After the signing is completed by all instances. The expense will be available to print by its creator. As soon as all the documents are printed, they need to be carried to the respective \textit{Finance admin} for further processing. The \textit{Finance admin} will send all relevant documents to the finance adminstration of the University of Zurich. This action completes the process.
